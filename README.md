# Secure Escrow
The Escrow app is a decentralized platform that facilitates secure and trustful transactions between parties. 
            - It utilizes blockchain
            technology and smart contracts to ensure transparency and
            enforceable agreements. 
            - With the Escrow app, two parties can engage
            in a transaction where funds or assets are held in escrow by a smart
            contract until predefined conditions are met.
            - This minimizes the risk of fraud and ensures that both parties fulfill their
            obligations before the funds or assets are released.
