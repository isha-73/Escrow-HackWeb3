<h2 align="center">Introduction 🚀</h2>

Secure Escrow is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. It provides a secure and trustless escrow service, facilitating secure transactions between buyers and sellers without the need for intermediaries.

<h2 align="center">What is Escrow ❓❔</h2>

- Escrow is a financial arrangement used to safeguard funds or assets during a transaction.
- It involves a neutral third party acting as an intermediary between the buyer and seller.
- The third party holds the funds or assets until all conditions of the transaction are met.
- Escrow is commonly used in real estate transactions, business deals, and online purchases.
- It helps protect both parties from fraud and ensures the transaction is completed fairly.

<h2 align="center">Project Overview 📝</h2>


The Secure Escrow project aims to create a transparent and secure platform for facilitating transactions, particularly useful for e-commerce, freelancing, and digital goods exchanges. It allows users to create escrow contracts, hold funds in a secure manner, and ensure successful delivery before releasing the funds to the seller.

<h2 align="center">Features ✨</h2>

- **Create Escrow Contract**: Users can create new escrow contracts with specific terms and conditions for the transaction.
- **Secure Fund Holding**: Funds are held securely in the escrow contract until the transaction is successfully completed.
- **Transaction Status Tracking**: Real-time tracking of transaction status (Open, Pending, Delivery, Confirmed, Disputed).
- **Buyer Protection**: Buyer can request refunds and dispute the transaction in case of issues.
- **Escrow Fee**: The platform charges a nominal escrow fee for its services to maintain and improve the system.
- **Decentralized and Trustless**: Transactions are performed on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries.
